Sleep Quality Prediction Model
This repository contains a sleep quality prediction model that analyzes sleep data to predict sleep quality. The model uses data preprocessing techniques including pipelines, column transformers, and encoding for string data. It also employs scaling and trains the dataset using linear regression, achieving a Mean Squared Error (MSE) score of 97.

Overview
This project aims to predict sleep quality based on various features from a dataset that includes real-world sleep data. The model is built using linear regression and has been evaluated to achieve an MSE score of 97. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

Dataset
Source: Collected from [mention source if applicable]

Features:

Duration of sleep

Sleep stages

Environmental factors (e.g., noise, light)

Physical activity

Other relevant sleep metrics

Data Preprocessing
Pipelines:

Created pipelines to streamline the preprocessing workflow.

Column Transformer:

Applied column transformers for handling numerical and categorical data.

Encoding:

Encoded string data using one-hot encoding and label encoding where appropriate.

Scaling:

Applied standard scaling to normalize the numerical features.

Model Training
Algorithm: Linear Regression

Mean Squared Error (MSE): 97

Model Evaluation
Evaluated the model using MSE and other relevant metrics.
